This is a cheatsheat for git, I will update is as I learn new things

Commands related to a remote repo:
    - git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
    - git push
    - git push origin main

Commands related to the workflow:
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "Message describing the snapshot"

Commands related to checking status or log history:
    - git status
    - git log

The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination
ie. git add . is read as -> git | add | .
    git commit -m "message" is read as -> git | commit -m | "message"
    git status is read as -> git | status | (no destination)
